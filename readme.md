Angular Pdf JS
--------------

Angular services for working with PDF.JS.

Includes render queuing and text layer extraction.

Include js from dist/angular-pdf.js, add angular module dependency on 'angular-pdf-js'

The angular-pdf.js file includes PDF.js.

If you are just looking for a way to display a PDF in an angular application then I recommend starting with this project :
